# odin-calculator

This project is part of The Odin Projects foundations course. In it, I'll be making a calculator using what I've learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The calculator is functional, but it has some bugs if you press buttons in a random order.
I will come back and fix these bugs, and add a GUI, at a later date.
